# LearningThreeJS
  This repository is dedicated to threeJS projects with increasing complexity. Every folder contains a stand-alone project that I worked on. At the time of creating this repository, I look forward to learning threeJS. This repository would ultimately show my aptitude as a client to ThreeJS. This learning journey is mainly inspired by Bruno Simon work using the library. Here: https://bruno-simon.com/
